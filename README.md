University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison
STAT 240: Introduction to Data Modeling I
 
## Description:  

Introduces students to reproducible data management, modeling, and analysis through a practical, hands-on case studies approach. Topics include the use of an integrated statistical computing environment, data wrangling, the R programming language, data graphics and visualization, random variables and concepts of probability, data modeling, and report generation using R Markdown with applications to a wide variety of data to address open-ended questions.


## Learning Outcomes:  

Statistics 240 aims to provide a thorough introduction to the concepts and methods of statistical data science and data modeling.  It is the first course in a two-course sequence.  Students can expect to spend time each week viewing the posted lecture content, reading from the textbook or other assigned readings, working through examples, doing the homework exercises, and generally becoming skilled in statistical computing and thinking statistically.

Students who complete this course successfully will learn to:

wrangle data: transform data, possibly from multiple sources, into a form convenient for analysis;

explore data: visualize and summarize data, generate questions/hypotheses, and address them;

program: write R code using the RStudio integrated statistical computing environment to carry out data wrangling, graphical data exploration, and analysis that is reproducible;

model data: provide low-dimensional summaries of data that capture signal and quantify the noise; assess the adequacy of the model; understand random variables and probability concepts associated with the models;

interpret data: explain what can be inferred from the data analysis and make predictions;

communicate: use R Markdown to integrate prose, visualizations, code, interpretation, and results;

collaborate: work with other students to solve data challenges.


Furthermore, students will learn about:

statistical inference: the construction and interpretation of confidence intervals and the calculation and interpretation of p-values for hypothesis tests for a number of settings including one- and two-sample proportions and means

simple linear regression: the construction and interpretation of regression models for two quantitative variables

## Grading:  

The final course grade will be determined by a score made up from the weighted sources below.

Component	Percent of Overall Grade

Discussion group assignments(lowest score dropped):	10%

Individual weekly assignments(lowest score dropped):	25%

Final Project 20%

Midterm Examination	20%

Final Examination	25%

Final grades for the course are only determined at the end of the course. These change slightly from semester to semester, so we unfortunately cannot provide grade boundaries so early on. However, usually the A/AB boundary is drawn somewhere in the low 90s, the AB/B boundary is usually in the mid 80s, the B/BC boundary is usually in the high 70s, and the BC/C boundary is usually in the low 70s.

## Discussion Sessions:   

Weekly discussion sessions will include a discussion assignment.  Discussion assignments are short group assignments meant to be completed as a group then submitted on canvas. Groups will be assigned early in the semester, and new groups may be assigned after the midterm exam.  Only one group member needs to turn in each group assignment, but all group members are expected to contribute to doing the work. Discussion assignments are intended to practice a single concept. Each discussion assignment will involve editing an R Markdown file to answer several questions, knitting the document to HTML, and uploading the knitted document to the Canvas web page.

Discussion assignments turned in within 24 hours after the due date may receive up to half credit. Discussion assignments turned in more than 24 hours late will not be graded and will receive no credit.

Your lowest single discussion assignment score is dropped.

Each student is expected to attend their discussion section meeting every week and meaningfully participate with their assigned group.   Students who are not present to contribute to the discussion assignment completion will not receive credit for the assignment.   Students will not be allowed to complete a discussion session assignment individually.

## Individual Assignments: 

In addition to group assignments in discussion sessions, there will be individual assignments.  These are assignments are longer than the group assignments.

Each homework assignment should be completed by creating an R Markdown document that combines text with chunks of code to produce graphics, carry out data analyses, and interpret results. Homework assignments should be well organized with all problems clearly marked and in order. Each problem solution should include a brief description of the problem (that may be paraphrased from the actual problem) as well as your work.  A typical weekly assignment includes a series of short problems aimed at demonstrating conceptual understanding and mastery of basic skills from the week plus a longer more open-ended data analysis project directed toward one or more questions of interest.

Late homework assignments turned in within 24 hours of the due date will receive half credit; assignments turned in over 24 hours late will receive no credit and will not receive feedback. Any exceptions must be approved by prior authorization from the instructor.

Completed homework assignments will be uploaded on Canvas and the submission typically will include (i) the completed R Markdown document and (ii) the knitted HTML document.

## Exams:  

There will be a midterm exam and a cumulative final exam. If you have any conflicts, please email me ASAP and we can discuss rescheduling. 
The midterm exam will be about 2-3 hours and will also be administered online & asynchronously. You will be given a 24-hour window in which you must start and finish the exam. The final will be a similar format, though it may be slightly longer in length. Obviously, you must work independently. Evidence of collaboration on an exam may lead to receiving zero credit and will be reported to campus authorities for potential further sanctions.
More info about the midterm and final format will be announced closer to the dates.

## Final group project:  

Each student will complete a project with an assigned group of students. The project will include the acquisition of a data from a novel source, an interesting question to address, the creation of an R Markdown document that contains a reproducible process of data manipulation, graphical exploration, modeling, analysis, and interpretation, using the appropriate methods from the course.  The project will culminate in a report displayed as an HTML document.
